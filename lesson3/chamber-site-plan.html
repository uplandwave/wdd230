        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>
            Scenario 1 
            If someone someday thought "Oh man I really wish i knew what businesses were growing in Holly Springs?" They could
            easily hop on our sight and find new and current data answering their question.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scenario 2 
            Let's say you just started your very own business and because you are not smart and your business stinks you could
            get on our site and add your business to our chamber of Commerce getting you new information and connections that 
            you could use to help your business
        </p>
        <p>
            Scenario 3
            In a grown up fast pace world where everyone is more concerned with their phone battery percentage rather than touching 
            grass meeting new people is hard. This is where we come in. Right on our site we will have a place for you to learn about
            people actually doing things. You could meet our directors or get in contact with business owners. It all stats when you
            want to.
