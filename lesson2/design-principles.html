            <p>Apples home page is a great example of contrast. The stark difference between the white 
                and black keeps the website looking clean and neat. Adding the contrast to this website 
                creates a better experience for the visiter. </p>

            <p>This design is perfectly minimal so that you can admire their page. It even has a light funnel 
                that leads you directly to build a website because you automatically know that there users know 
                what the site is about.   </p>
